### Summary of `openapi-client-axios` for a Junior Developer

`openapi-client-axios` is a JavaScript library that helps you automatically create API clients from an **OpenAPI specification** (a machine-readable document that describes how to interact with a web API). This means you don't need to manually write HTTP requests for APIs—the library does it for you!

#### Key Features:
1. **Automatic Client Generation**: It builds an API client dynamically at runtime based on the provided OpenAPI spec (JSON or YAML).
2. **Works with Axios**: It uses Axios, a popular HTTP client, under the hood to handle API requests and responses.
3. **TypeScript Support**: (If relevant) It can generate TypeScript types to help developers get IntelliSense and ensure type-safe API usage.
4. **Dynamic**: No code generation step is required. It just reads your OpenAPI spec at runtime and builds the client.

#### How It Works:
1. You provide the OpenAPI spec (a JSON or YAML file).
2. The library reads the spec and creates functions for all the API endpoints described in the spec.
3. You can call those functions directly instead of manually writing `axios` or `fetch` calls.

### Example Usage:

#### Install the Library:
```bash
npm install openapi-client-axios
```

#### Basic Code Example:
```javascript
import OpenAPIClientAxios from 'openapi-client-axios';

// Load your OpenAPI specification (can be a URL or local file path)
const apiSpec = 'https://example.com/openapi.json';

// Create an OpenAPI client instance
const api = new OpenAPIClientAxios({ definition: apiSpec });

// Initialize the client
const client = await api.init();

// Use the client to call an API endpoint
const response = await client.getUser({ userId: 123 });
console.log(response.data);
```

### Why Use It?
- **Time-Saving**: Instead of writing repetitive API requests, `openapi-client-axios` generates methods for you.
- **Error-Reduction**: It ensures your API calls match the spec, reducing bugs caused by typos or incorrect parameters.
- **Easy Maintenance**: If the API spec changes, you only need to update the spec file—no need to rewrite code.
