This is a typescript project.

pnpm is the package manager.

Add tests to `__tests__` folders proximate to the code they are testing.

Where possible practice TDD (Test Driven Development) and write tests before writing code to address a given task.

Run tests with `pnpm test`.

Even if you think you've fixed everything, always run `pnpm build` and `pnpm test` to be sure that everything is working before reporting that you're done.

We use vitest for testing. Do not use Jest or anything else.

When updating README.md keep the tone pragmatic and low key, avoid corporate or marketing speak. Be clear, concise, and to the point, try to practice "show don't tell".

Use native fetch over axios or other http clients.
